# Google Meet Refresher
This project is not affiliated with Google or Alphabet Inc. in any way.

This is a [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) script that makes [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) more convenient to use for school.

At my school, we have a constant Google Meet link for each class, for when we have to go remote.

We are given something like this link:

Unfortunately, when a remote student joins a class before a teacher starts the meeting on their end, the student has to sit and click 'refresh' over and over.

This is not just a button to make the student feel better either. The teacher can start a meeting and if the student does not refresh the page they will never know.

We just see this error page:

After having some teachers start their meeting late, and some teachers never start their meeting at all, I can say it is very annoying to waste your time sitting and clicking a button when you could be doing anything else.

This script fixes this issue, and automatically refreshes the page, so you can never miss a meeting.

Note: The timer counts down as the seconds decrease.

I only had to use this script for one week, but I experienced no problems. Feel free to file an issue if you have one.
